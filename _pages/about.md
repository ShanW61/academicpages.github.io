I'm a second-year master student in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Penn State University, a lab member in the Wellness & Health Innovation (WHI) Lab, advised by Dr. Saeed Abdullah, a Research Assistant in the Applied Cognitive Science (ACS) Lab, supervised by Dr. Frank Ritter, and a Teaching Assistant for IST 337 and SRA 231, supervised by Prof. Megan Costello. 

I'm interested in technologies for health and wellbeing, such as persuasive technologies for healthy behavior changes. My current project is to investigate the effects of humor level of prompts on prolonged sedentary behavior, stress, and perceived interruption.
