I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State University, advised by [Dr. Xinning Gui](https://www.xinninggui.com/). I'm interested in technologies for mental health and psychological wellbeing. 

I was a previous lab member in the [Wellness & Health Innovation (WHI) Lab](https://whilab.org/), advised by [Dr. Saeed Abdullah](https://saeedabdullah.com/publications.html). I worked as a Research Assistant in the [Applied Cognitive Science (ACS) Lab](http://acs.ist.psu.edu/wp/), supervised by [Dr. Frank Ritter](http://www.frankritter.com/ritter.html), and a Teaching Assistant supervised by [Prof. Megan Costello](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/muc148). 

Some quotes I love:<br/>
"Let everything happen to you. Beauty and Terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final." - Rainer Maria Rilke<br/>
"Stay hungry. Stay foolish." - Steve Jobs
