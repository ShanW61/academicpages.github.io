I'm a second-year master student in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Penn State University, a lab member in the [Wellness & Health Innovation (WHI) Lab](https://whilab.org/), advised by [Dr. Saeed Abdullah](https://saeedabdullah.com/publications.html). I'm interested in technologies for health and wellbeing, such as persuasive technologies for healthy behavior changes. I use mixed methods to understand how people interact with technologies, design and evaluate tech for health and wellbeing purposes. My current project is to investigate the effects of humor level of prompts on prolonged sedentary behavior, stress, and perceived interruption.


In my other time, I work as a Research Assistant in the [Applied Cognitive Science (ACS) Lab](http://acs.ist.psu.edu/wp/), supervised by [Dr. Frank Ritter](http://www.frankritter.com/ritter.html), and a Teaching Assistant supervised by [Prof. Megan Costello](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/muc148).
